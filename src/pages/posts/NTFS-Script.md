## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction: Why NTFS Drives and macOS Need a Love Story 💔

macOS users, raise your hand if you’ve been frustrated trying to write to an NTFS drive 🙋. You plug in your external drive, only to realize you’re in a **read-only relationship** with it. It’s like having a car but only being allowed to admire it from afar. 🚗✨

But fear not! Today, we’re fixing this, and we’ll make the process not just functional but *fun*! 🥳

---

## <a name="mission"></a> Our Mission: Automate Everything! 🤖

We’ll:
- Automatically detect NTFS drives.
- Mount them with full read/write capabilities.
- Let you create, edit, delete, and manage files/folders like a boss! 💼

All while sipping coffee. ☕ Let’s dive in!

## <a name="prerequisites"></a> Pre-requisites: Tools of the Trade 🛠️

1. **Install Homebrew** 🍺:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. **Get `ntfs-3g`** 🚀:
   ```bash
   brew install ntfs-3g

2. **Python (v3.x)`** 🐍:
  - Already on macOS? perfect. If not, install it:
   ```bash
   brew install python3

## <a name="prerequisites"></a> The Python Script: Your Loyal Sidekick 🐍

Here’s the hero of our story. Copy-paste the script below into a file called `ntfs_manager.py`

```python
import os
import subprocess
import time

NTFS_MOUNT_BASE = "/Volumes/NTFSDrive"  # Base folder for mounting NTFS drives

def get_ntfs_drives():
    """Detect NTFS drives connected to the system."""
    print("Checking for NTFS drives...")
    result = subprocess.run(["diskutil", "list"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    drives = []
    for line in result.stdout.splitlines():
        if "Microsoft Basic Data" in line:  # NTFS drives often show as "Microsoft Basic Data"
            parts = line.split()
            if len(parts) > 0:
                drives.append(parts[5])  # The disk identifier
    return drives

def mount_ntfs(drive):
    """Mount an NTFS drive with write access."""
    mount_point = f"{NTFS_MOUNT_BASE}/{drive.replace('/', '-')}"
    os.makedirs(mount_point, exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Mounting NTFS drive {drive} at {mount_point}...")
    command = f"sudo ntfs-3g /dev/{drive} {mount_point} -o rw,auto,nobrowse"
    result = subprocess.run(command.split(), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        print(f"Drive {drive} mounted successfully at {mount_point}.")
    else:
        print(f"Error mounting drive {drive}: {result.stderr}")

def monitor_drives():
    """Continuously monitor for new NTFS drives."""
    print("Starting NTFS drive monitor...")
    already_mounted = set()
    while True:
        current_drives = set(get_ntfs_drives())
        new_drives = current_drives - already_mounted
        for drive in new_drives:
            mount_ntfs(drive)
        already_mounted.update(new_drives)
        time.sleep(5)  # Check for new drives every 5 seconds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_drives()
```

Save and secure it like treasure! 💎

## <a name="automation"></a> Automation with `launchd`: Magic on Insert ✨

Let’s make this script run automatically when an NTFS drive is inserted.

1. **Create a launchd plist File 📝**

Save this file as `com.user.ntfsmonitor.plist` in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.user.ntfsmonitor</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/python3</string>
        <string>/path/to/ntfs_manager.py</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>WatchPaths</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Volumes</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Replace /path/to/ntfs_manager.py with the full path to your script.

2. **Load the Daemon 🚀**

Activate it with:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.ntfsmonitor.plist
```

## <a name="testing"></a> Testing and Enjoying the Setup 🎉

1. Insert an NTFS drive.

2. Watch the magic! The drive will be mounted automatically. 🧙‍♂️

3. Navigate to /Volumes/NTFSDrive/ to start creating/editing files and folders. 📁
